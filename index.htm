            <h2>Company Formation in Dubai
            </h2>
            <hr id="overviewline">
            <p>One of the biggest cities in the Middle East is Dubai, which provides a wide range of business
                opportunities for the establishment of various types of firms by international investors. To ensure that
                trade and business in the region continue to grow, this city has increased its opportunities. In
                addition, Dubai has diversified its economy so that less than 1% of its total GDP comes from oil output.

                The speed of Dubai's diversification and long-term economic growth has quickened. Business-friendly
                government policies and programmes, tax structures, and infrastructure, to name a few, are the key
                drivers of the expansion. It is clear from the discussion above that Dubai is a great site to start
                business in Dubai, and that business owners, especially international investors, can benefit much from
                forming a firm here.</p>

                                Dubai. Atleast 10 founders and a minimum share capital of AED 10,000,000 are required
